  <h1>Real Facts</h1>
  <h2>Elephant</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The elephant, one of the largest land mammals, is known for its impressive size and intelligence. These majestic creatures are recognized by their long trunks, large ears, and tusks, which are among their most notable features.</p>
    <p>Elephants are social animals and live in tight-knit family groups led by a matriarch. These groups are typically composed of female elephants and their offspring, while males tend to leave the group once they reach maturity.</p>
    <p>Elephants have an extraordinary memory and are capable of remembering individuals and locations for many years. This ability helps them navigate vast landscapes and find water sources in times of drought.</p>
    <p>One of the most fascinating facts about elephants is their trunks. These trunks are incredibly versatile, acting as both a nose for breathing and smelling, as well as a tool for grasping objects, drinking water, and even communicating with other elephants.</p>
    <p>Elephants are herbivores, feeding on a variety of plants such as grass, fruits, and bark. They are known to consume large quantities of food daily, with an adult elephant eating up to 300 kilograms of vegetation in a single day.</p>
    <p>Despite their enormous size, elephants are known to be gentle and empathetic animals. They exhibit complex emotions such as grief, joy, and even altruism, often helping other elephants in distress.</p>
    <p>Elephants are also highly intelligent and have demonstrated problem-solving skills and self-awareness. They are capable of using tools, recognizing themselves in mirrors, and exhibiting behaviors that suggest deep cognitive abilities.</p>
    <p>Elephants communicate using a wide range of vocalizations, including trumpets, grunts, and low-frequency rumbles that can travel great distances. These sounds help them stay connected with each other, even over long distances.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, elephants are facing significant threats due to habitat loss, poaching for their ivory tusks, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure their survival in the wild.</p>
    <p>As of now, there are two species of elephants: the African elephant, which is larger and has larger ears, and the Asian elephant, which is slightly smaller and has smaller ears. Both species are endangered, with the African elephant classified as vulnerable and the Asian elephant classified as endangered.</p>
    <p>Elephant populations have significantly declined over the past century due to hunting for ivory, loss of habitat, and human encroachment. It is estimated that fewer than 400,000 elephants remain in the wild today.</p>
    <p>In recent years, global efforts have been made to combat poaching and protect elephant habitats. Countries such as Botswana, Tanzania, and India have established wildlife reserves and stricter laws to safeguard elephants from illegal hunting.</p>
    <p>Elephants have cultural significance in many parts of the world. In Hinduism, the elephant-headed god Ganesha is a symbol of wisdom and good fortune. In African cultures, elephants are often seen as symbols of strength, wisdom, and leadership.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, elephants play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. As they feed on trees and plants, they help to shape the environment and ensure the survival of other species by preventing overgrowth and allowing new vegetation to thrive.</p>
    <p>Overall, elephants are remarkable creatures, revered for their intelligence, social bonds, and role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. However, they need our help to survive in an increasingly human-dominated world.</p>
